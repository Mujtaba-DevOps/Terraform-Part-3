Terraform – Part 2 
This project is a continuation of my Terraform learning journey. 
In this repo, I’m exploring hands-on practices with AWS, dynamic blocks, variables, and state management using Terraform.

What I Learned
1.Creating AWS EC2 instances and installing Nginx automatically
2.Using Dynamic Blocks (for_each, count) to make infrastructure flexible
3.Working with Input Variables (variable) and Output Variables (output) for reusable and manageable code
4.Managing Terraform state with remote backends (S3) and state locking (DynamoDB)

How to Use
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Mujtaba-DevOps/Terraform-Part-2.git
cd Terraform-Part-2

Initialize Terraform:
terraform init

Apply the configuration:
terraform apply
